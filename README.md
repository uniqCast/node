# Node.js
Tasks and guides that should help you learn [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api)

## Tasks

Your assignment will be to solve a number of tasks targeted at sharpening your Node.js skills. All tasks
are solvable even if you are not an experienced backend developer as the point of tasks itself is
to make you learn Node.js.

Once you have a task ready for review, send a pull request to `solutions` branch stored into
directory by your `username` and `task{number}`. This is mostly to make you learn about branches and
reviewing process as soon as possible.

Take your time. We put more focus on quality of code over speed of coding, since in time, quality of
code will directly regulate speed of coding.

There are few things to remember:

* communication - if you have an issue, ask
* team - you work with other people, everything you write will at some time be read and need to be
changed by someone else
* code - code must be clean, unneeded space and old code in comments should never be upstream
* comments - your code is not self documenting but it doesn't need a comment of every line, describe
complex blocks and modules so even a newcomer can understand what was the target

## Subtasks

* find grammatical errors and send a pull request with fixes
* send pull requests to improve what you think could be better
* write a new task that you think would be useful for people when learning Node.js
* add .gitignore to exclude files that should not be upstream
* use git rebase instead of git pull/merge
